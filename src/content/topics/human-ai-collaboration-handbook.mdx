## The companion you didn't know you needed

AI Lab goes deep. We explore the mechanics, the implementation details, the real-world setups. That's valuable when you're building something or solving a specific problem.

But sometimes you just need the principle. Fast.

That's what the [Human-AI Collaboration Handbook](https://handbook.turtleand.com) is for.

## AI Lab vs Handbook: different tools for different moments

**AI Lab:** You're implementing a multi-tool workflow. You need to understand how the pieces fit together, what the edge cases are, how to debug when things break. You read the full topic, follow the examples, adapt to your setup.

**Handbook:** You're about to start a session with Claude. You want to remember the core principle: "Start with outcome, not steps." You check the Handbook, get the 30-second reminder, close the tab, go build.

They're not competing. They're complementary.

## What's inside

The Handbook covers six categories:

- **Mindset:** How to think about AI collaboration (not delegation)
- **Workflow:** Practical patterns for daily work
- **Economics:** Cost management and model selection
- **Quality:** Output standards and iteration strategies
- **Organizational Knowledge:** Memory systems and context management
- **Human Element:** Maintaining agency and preventing learned helplessness

Each principle is short, opinionated, and builder-focused. No theory for theory's sake.

## Open source, like everything else

The Handbook is built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) and hosted on Netlify. Source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/turtleand/handbook). If you see something that should be there and isn't, open an issue or PR.

We built it because we kept forgetting our own best practices. Now they're a bookmark away.
