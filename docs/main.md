Create a product specification for the AI Lab site as a blog-style page similar to Build, but centered on AI research, experiments, and tutorials. Return the spec in Markdown with concise sections for: purpose/positioning, target audiences, goals and success metrics, content strategy (AI stories, demos, how-tos, labs), page architecture (hero, narrative blocks, callouts for experiments, component library), information hierarchy, user journeys, and clear acceptance criteria. Define visual/brand direction that feels technical yet welcoming, with references to data viz/interactive elements, while keeping copy and assets as placeholders. Detail technical requirements for an Astro build from bare-bones scaffolding (no starter template), including structure, components, content pipeline (MDX/Markdown), SEO, analytics, performance, and accessibility expectations. Note dependencies, risks, and out-of-scope items, plus milestone slices for MVP -> polish. Do not generate the site or filler copy; only produce the specification.
