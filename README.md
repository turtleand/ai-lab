The Turtleand AI Lab: POC, roadmap, articles and experiments to learn about the explosive AI ecosystem

## Topic + translation checklist (template)
- Create the English topic file in `src/content/topics/<slug>.mdx`.
- Create the Spanish translation in `src/content/topics-es/<slug>.mdx`.
- Keep the same `subtopic` value in both files.
- Ensure frontmatter has `title`, `module`, `subtopic`, `summary`.
- Link any images under `public/images/topics/` and keep the same asset path in both languages.
- Verify both pages render and appear in module lists (if the module list is still manually defined).
